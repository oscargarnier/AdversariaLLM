    Dynamically adjust batch size if an OOM error occurs.
    Also tries increasing batch size when many batches succeed consecutively.

    Args:
        function: Callable
            A function that takes one or more arguments and returns a tensor or list of tensors.
            All input arguments should have the same length in their first dimension (batch dimension).
        *inputs:
            The inputs to pass to the function. All inputs must be tensors or lists and have the same length in their first dimension.
        initial_batch_size: int | None, default None
            Starting batch size for execution. If None, the batch size is set to the closest power of two of the input length.
        verbose: bool, default False
            Whether to print progress.
        success_threshold: int, default 64
            Number of consecutive successful batches before attempting to double batch size.
    Returns:
        The output of the function.
